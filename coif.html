            <h1 id="hone">Code Of Indian Flag</h1>
        <div class="container">
            <p id="pone">

                According to the Flag Code of India, the national flag of India is officially characterised as follows:
                "India green will be the colour of the bottom panel, and India saffron (Kesari) will be the colour of
                the
                top panel. The main panel will be white and have a navy blue Ashoka Chakra pattern with 24 evenly spaced
                spokes at its centre." It was become the official flag of the Dominion of India on July 22, 1947, when
                the Constituent Assembly of India accepted it in its current form. The Republic of India continued to
                fly
                the same flag after that. The Indian national flag is usually generally referred to as the "tricolour"
                in
                India (Hindi:, Tirag). The flag's foundation on the Swaraj flag, which Pingali Venkayya created for the
                Indian National Congress. Less than twenty weavers in India claim to be capable of this highly unusual
                form
                of weaving. The specifications specify that there should be precisely 205 grammes per square foot, 150
                threads per square centimetre, and four threads each stitch.

                Public waving of the paper flag is permitted for significant national, cultural, and sporting events.
                However, after the occasion, these paper Flags shouldn't be tossed away or left lying around. In keeping
                with the dignity of the Flag, it should be disposed of privately wherever feasible.

                Only khadi, or hand-spun cloth, may be used to make a flag, and flying a flag made of any other material
                is
                illegal and subject to fines and jail time of up to three years. Cotton, silk, and wool are the only
                acceptable raw materials for khadi. Khadi is used in two different ways: The first is khadi-bunting,
                which
                is the fabric that makes up the body of the flag, and the second is khadi-duck, a piece of beige fabric
                that
                fastens the flag to the pole. Unlike the two weaves used in traditional weaving, the khadi-duck uses
                three
                threads to create a single weave.
